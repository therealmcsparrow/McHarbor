# OpenRouter: Developer

How this plugin is put together, and what to change if you fork it.

## What it registers

It implements `AdapterContributor` and registers one adapter in `RegisterAdapters`:

```go
func (p *Plugin) RegisterAdapters(reg plugin.AdapterRegistry) error {
    return reg.AI().Register(
        plugin.AIAdapterSpec{
            Slug:         p.manifest.Slug,
            DisplayName:  "OpenRouter",
            Icon:         "plugin.svg",
            Capabilities: plugin.AIAdapterCapabilities{ /* … */ },
            ConfigSchema: configSchema(),
        },
        newClient(),
    )
}
```

The spec is what the host renders and dispatches on; the client is what does the work.
Every other `Register*` method on the `Plugin` interface is a no-op here.

## What the host calls, and when

| Call | When | What it returns |
|---|---|---|
| `TestConnection` | You press **Test** on the connection | Reachability and whether the credential is accepted |
| `ListModels` | The model dropdown is opened | The model ids this key or server can use |
| `Complete` | Every assistant turn, and every workflow AI node | One completed response |

## Source layout

| File | Lines |
|---|---|
| `backend/main.go` | 137 |
| `backend/openrouter_client.go` | 427 |

This plugin ships no frontend bundle. The host renders its configuration form from the
`ConfigSchema` the adapter spec declares.

## Manifest

`plugin.yaml` is the source of truth. The loader mounts only what it declares, so code
that is registered but not declared is unreachable.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `slug` | `ai-provider-openrouter` |
| `version` | 2026.09.01 |
| `mcharbor` | `>=2026.09.01`, the host range the installer enforces |
| `go` | `>=1.23` |
| `license` | McHarbor |
| `permissions` | `ai.adapter.register`, `encryption.handle.read`, `audit.emit` |
| `adds_permissions` | _none_ |
| `contributes.i18n_namespaces` | _none_ |
| `contributes.forms` | _none_ |
| `migrations` | _none_ |

## Building it

There are no per-plugin Makefiles in this repository. `src/plugins/Makefile` iterates
`Plugins/*/Makefile`, which matches nothing today, so its `build` and `sign` targets are
no-ops. Build it the way the image does instead:

```bash
cd src/plugins/Plugins/ai-provider-openrouter
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -trimpath -buildmode=plugin -o backend/ai-provider-openrouter.so ./backend
```

The `.so` has to be built against the **same** Go toolchain and module graph as the host
binary, or `plugin.Open` rejects it with `plugin was built with a different version of
package …`. That is why `docker/Dockerfile` compiles the host binary and every bundled
plugin inside one `RUN`, sharing one module cache and one build cache.

For a plugin that ships in the image, the only reliable way to get a rebuild into a
running McHarbor is to rebuild the image:

```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
```

The entrypoint then copies the bundled `.so` over the installed one and re-extracts the
matching tarball payload, so the frontend bundle, i18n and icons move with it.

## Signing it

Only needed to distribute outside the image. Signing uses ed25519 through PyNaCl:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r src/plugins/scripts/requirements-signing.txt
.venv/bin/python src/plugins/scripts/sign-plugin.py \
  --tarball dist/mcharbor-plugin-ai-provider-openrouter-1.0.0.tar.gz \
  --key signing/plugin-signing.key
```

It writes a base64 ed25519 signature next to the tarball as `.sig`, which is exactly what
the installer verifies. Keep the private half out of the repository, and add the public
half to the host's trust list through `MCHARBOR_PLUGIN_TRUST_KEYS`.

Install the tarball from **App Store → Plugins**, or drop it into a catalog directory
the host reads.

## Forking it

1. Copy the folder to a new slug and change `slug`, `name` and `homepage` in
   `plugin.yaml`. The slug has to match the directory name.
2. Change the provider type so it does not
   collide with this plugin's. Two plugins cannot claim the same key.
3. Declare any permission keys you add in `adds_permissions`, with a scope no wider than
   the resource they gate.
4. Update `ConfigSchema` for the fields your service needs, then the client that reads
   them.
5. Add an `i18n/` folder and declare the namespace if your fork has UI strings.
6. Rebuild, re-sign with your own key, and add that key to the host's trust list
   (`MCHARBOR_PLUGIN_TRUST_KEYS`).
